    ingredients: 'Sauce: \n- 4 tbsp honey\n- 2 tbsp soy sauce (all purpose or light soy sauce)\n- 1 tbsp white vinegar (or sub with any other vinegar except balsamic)\n- 1 large garlic clove (or 2 small) minced\n\nSalmon:\n- 2 salmon or trout fillets, skinless (6oz / 200g each)\n- Olive oil\n-  Salt and pepper\n-  Optional Garnishes\n-  Sesame seeds\n-  Finely sliced chives or shallots/scallions',
    directions: '1. Take salmon out of the fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Pat salmon skin dry with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n2. Whisk together the Sauce ingredients in a small bowl.\n3. Drizzle oil in a non stick fry pan and heat over medium high heat (or just under, if your stove runs hot). Place salmon in the pan, and cook the first side for 3 minutes. Turn, then cook the other side for 2 minutes, or to taste.\n4. Pour Sauce over salmon. Cook for 1 minute or until it starts to thicken slightly. Check the side of the salmon to tell how cooked through the middle is - I like mine rare inside. (Note 1). If Sauce thickens too much before your salmon is cooked to your taste, just add water 1 tbsp at a time.\n5. Remove onto serving plates. 6. Serve salmon drizzled with Sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds and chives/shallots, if desired.',
