Whisk together the Sauce ingredients in a small bowl.\n3. Drizzle oil in a non stick fry pan and heat over medium high heat (or just under, if your stove runs hot). Place salmon in the pan, and cook the first side for 3 minutes. Turn, then cook the other side for 2 minutes, or to taste.\n4. Pour Sauce over salmon. Cook for 1 minute or until it starts to thicken slightly. Check the side of the salmon to tell how cooked through the middle is - I like mine rare inside. (Note 1). If Sauce thickens too much before your salmon is cooked to your taste, just add water 1 tbsp at a time.\n5. Remove onto serving plates. 6. Serve salmon drizzled with Sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds and chives/shallots, if desired.',
